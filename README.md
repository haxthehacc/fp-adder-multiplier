# fp-adder-multiplier
Adder and multiplier for single-precision floating point numbers in the IEEE 754-2008 format. 

A module that integrates both the adder and multiplier modules into one is in the works.
The adder uses 3 modules: compandshift, addition and normalisation. The multiplier is a standalone module.
