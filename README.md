# fp-adder-multiplier
Adder and multiplier for single-precision floating point numbers in the IEEE 754-2008 format. 

The adder uses 3 modules: compandshift, addition and normalisation. The multiplier is a standalone module. 

A module that integrates both the adder and multiplier modules into one is in the works.



(Yes, it is extremely unoptimized. No, I will never use this in my life and neither do I expect anyone to use this for anything other than academic purposes.)
